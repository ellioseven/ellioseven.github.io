title: "Theory - Development Best Practices"

A living article devoted to my development best practices interpretation:

## Do not repeat yourself

This means placing duplicated code in functions or referring to original source of documentation
## Document your code

Write descriptive inline documentation. Keep an updated README as you develop. Document any important documentation (that doesn't belong in the code) in the project's Confluence space

## Don't rush

## Quality over quantity

Resist the pressure to merge a branch or deploy a feature because you "need it now"

## Do your research

If you have a problem, find out if some one has already solved it. Don't write your own recursive utility function when drupal_array_get_nested_value() already exists. This applies to error messages as well

## Plan

Before writing a whole bunch of code, find out exactly what you are trying to achieve and visualise an overview of how you are going to do it. Resist the temptation to dump straight into your IDE.

## Keep it simple

Don't make something more complex than it needs to be. Focus on readability and flexibility when writing code.
