With the release of Drupal 8.4.0, core has now [adopted the airbnb JavaScript
style guide](https://www.drupal.org/node/2815077) and now embraces ES6. I have
put together some resources to learn new ES6 features as well as a basic guide
for developing on ES6.

## Resources

- [ES6 Features](http://es6-features.org) - Reference
- [ECMAScript 6 Learning](https://github.com/ericdouglas/ES6-Learning) - A
  collection of learning resources

## Developing on ES6

### Compatibility

#### Babel

#### Polyfills
